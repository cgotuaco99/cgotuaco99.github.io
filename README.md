## My Projects

### Google Review Data Visualization
[Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/christopher.gotuaco#!/?newProfile=&activeTab=0)  

I built this dashboard using Google review data and Python to help businesses identify potential locations that would maximize profit. This involved cleaning the review data, creating consumer personas, and visualizing the data in Tableau, including displaying trends in topics mentioned and positive/negative reviews over time.


### Stocktwits Sentiment Prediction
In this project I am working to determine the accuracy of groups of Stocktwits users in predicting trends in stock performance over a specific period of time. In the dataset I am using, around half of the tweets are tagged with "Bullish" or "Bearish", and the other half are untagged. I am using NLP to tag the other tweets based on the original tagged tweets. I am then using linear regression models to determine the extent of the ability of these tweets to predict actual stock performance.
